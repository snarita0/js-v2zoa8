/*
Challenge #1: Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
  BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter). 

Your tasks:
  1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables.
  2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions).
  3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. 

Test data:
  ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
  ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76m tall. 

Challenge #2:
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it. 

Your tasks:
  1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!" 
  2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
